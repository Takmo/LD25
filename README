Ludum Dare 25 Project - Theme: UNKNOWN

This game will be a 2D topdown action/adventure/rpg game. The
world will be continuous, meaning no loading screens when
travelling from place to place. It will have background music,
sounds, possibly NPCs, possibly dialog, and possibly warps.

All of the specifics will be determined after the theme has
been decided and an idea has been determined.

Minimum requirements:

World that can be loaded in chunks via a specific map format.

Optional animated sprites.

Input.

Camera movement.

Basic interface options.

Pause menu.

Sound Manager for loading and playing sounds.
