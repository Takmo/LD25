	NOTES ON REFERENCES

	Every resource has a reference count. Every time you
	access a resource, you add one to the reference count.
	When you are finished with a resource, you must dereference
	it. This is to make sure that no resources are being used
	when the Warehouse is closed. This is also useful for
	preventing memory leaks!
